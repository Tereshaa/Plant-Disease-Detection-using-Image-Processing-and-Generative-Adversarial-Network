# Plant Disease Detection using Image Processing and GAN

## Project Overview
This project uses Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to detect plant diseases based on image processing. The model uses a combination of a generator and a discriminator to create and classify images, respectively. The generator creates fake images of healthy plants or plants with diseases, while the discriminator learns to distinguish between real and generated images.
and the classification model provides the output for the model.
## Features
- Detects plant diseases from images using GANs.
- Uses image preprocessing and data augmentation techniques like U-Net and GANs to enhance the model's performance.
- The model is built using TensorFlow and Keras.
